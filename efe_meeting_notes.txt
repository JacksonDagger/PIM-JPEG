- Figure out the behaviour of decompressor when huffman table and dct table is unchanged but compressed data is missing for some parts?
	- Do we also need to do line skipping correspondence in hufmann table? Because if we keep row 0 skip 1 keep 2 row 2 etc but don't change the correspondence in the table will it result in incorrect output? I think it will
- Figure out the pixel block size or row block size
